# Project Title

AUTOMATION OF STUDENT EDUCATION VERIFICATION AND SERVICES


# About the Project

Rendering a Bonafide certificate, Letter of Recommendation and verifying a student's background is an obligatory activity of every college. However, well established institutions at times may find it tedious to issue them when the procedure is extensive or when there is a substantial number of applicants.
The proposed system is completely automated which decreases the time consumption and manual tasks performed during background verification and while issuing a Bonafide or an LOR. Using this web application, the student authentication process, request approval and providing letter can be done on a single platform from any place making it quickly accessible. As an added feature, a unique software is developed that automatically parses the mail contents sent by a background verifier and matches it with the student database to find if the information is genuine or not with an automated reply email.
